# Items for discussion

### Finalising the model

 - Choose final model (need to pick which performance function works best).
 
 - Which parameters to manipulate in simulation study?

 - Lower case greek letters for each parameter or should effort baseline, initial effort, initial goal be the word with some subscript?
 
 - Need to compare the models to simpler alternatives to establish necessity. Could we compare the models to alternatives where either effort or goal do not update at all? Are these two simple? What other ones.
 
### Finishing the paper

 - Where does the hierarchical structure fit in to the modeling? Does it go in Step 2 (Model fitting) or is it a 4th step that involves interpretting the model parameters. On the one hand, the hierarchical structure always needs to be a consideration for model fitting, but this might disrupt the flow of the paper.

 - Do we need a recent grad student to look over paper?
 
 - Hector to look over code and help with documentation?
 
 - How do we bring Mark back in?
