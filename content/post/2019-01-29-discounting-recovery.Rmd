* Attendees: Ash, Manos, Tim

* Manos in Australia from 1st to 26th (?) of April. Organise visit?

* Where are we at with the project?

  * Fitted Manos data using hierarchical Bayesian using 11 models
  * For each model, randomly sampled 100 parameters from participant-level distributions
  * For each sampled parameter, simulated 100 ficticious participants and fit a person-level model     to each group of participants (we did this for each model).
  
* Next steps

  * Tim to start tex document on overleaf.
  * Manos to ask for Junyi's data.
  * Ash to check whether we can use Graham's data.
  * When we get data, Tim to send Manos code for running analysis on cluster.
  * Tim to, before next meeting, summarize results of first recovery analysis.
