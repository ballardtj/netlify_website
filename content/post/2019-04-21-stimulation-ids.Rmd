* Attendees:Hannah Filmer, Tim

*Agenda:

* Tim to calculate Bayes factors for effects.

* Run a model with just GABA and Glutamate - 

* Reviewed model. Model might not be specified properly. ID variables should predict __difference__ in pre-post change between stimulation and sham conditions. Currently, it predicts pre-post change seperately, and then we take the difference between those coefficients. 
  * Model should predict __disruption__ which is calculated by first calculating change from pre-post in each stimulation condition, then taking the difference between those between active and sham. End up with two disruptions: and one for cathodal.
  
  * Tim to run model with polynomial regression terms.
  * Add PFC white matter. (hannag to send me)
